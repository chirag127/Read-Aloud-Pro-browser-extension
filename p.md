**4. User Personas & Scenarios**

*   **4.1. Primary Persona(s):**
    *   **Alex (Student):** Needs to read long articles for research. Prefers listening while commuting or doing chores. Needs accurate highlighting to follow along easily. Values simple controls.
    *   **Priya (Professional):** Multitasks frequently, wants to listen to industry news while managing emails. Needs quick ways to start reading selected text or whole articles. Values independent volume control.
    *   **Sam (Visually Impaired User):** Relies on screen readers but wants a simpler tool specifically for web page articles. Needs clear audio, easy controls accessible via keyboard, and reliable highlighting.
*   **4.2. Key User Scenarios / Use Cases:**
    *   **Reading a full article:** User navigates to a news article, clicks the extension icon, clicks "Start Reading". Listens to the article with synchronized highlighting, using the floating bar to pause/resume.
    *   **Reading a specific section:** User highlights a paragraph of interest, right-clicks, selects "Read selected text".
    *   **Starting from a specific point:** User right-clicks on a paragraph header, selects "Read from this text onwards".
    *   **Adjusting speech:** User finds the default speed too fast, opens Settings via the floating bar, adjusts the rate slider, selects a preferred voice, and resumes reading.
    *   **Controlling playback:** User needs to answer the phone, clicks Pause on the floating bar. Later clicks Play to resume. Skips a sentence using the skip forward button.

**5. User Stories**

*(Illustrative examples - A full list would be generated during development)*

*   **US1:** As a user, I want to click a single button in the extension popup to start reading the main content of the current page, so I can easily listen to articles.
*   **US2:** As a user, I want to see the word currently being spoken highlighted with a distinct background color, so I can follow along visually.
*   **US3:** As a user, I want a floating control bar to appear when reading starts, so I can easily pause, play, stop, or skip sentences.
*   **US4:** As a user, I want the floating control bar to be draggable and to hide automatically when not needed, so it doesn't obstruct the page content.
*   **US5:** As a user, I want to select text on a page, right-click, and choose "Read selected text", so I can listen to specific parts of the content.
*   **US6:** As a user, I want to access settings to change the speech rate, pitch, voice, and volume, so I can customize the listening experience to my preference.
*   **US7:** As a user, I want my settings to be saved automatically, so I don't have to reconfigure them every time I use the extension.
*   **US8:** As a user navigating with a keyboard, I want to be able to activate all controls (popup, floating bar, settings) using keyboard commands (e.g., Tab, Enter, Space).
